'''
A train is identified by its name and list of compartments.
The compartments are identified by its name,total seating capacity and the number of passengers.
Implement the class Train as given in the class diagram.

Train
------------------------
- train_name
- compartment_list
---------------------------------
__init__(train_name,compartment_list)
+ get_train_name()
+ get_compartment_list()
+ count_compartments ()
+ check_vacancy()
---------------------------------------


Write a python program to implement the following:

count_compartments()- returns the total number of compartments in the train
check_vacancy()-returns the count of the compartments in which more than 50% of the seats are vacant
Note : Compartment list is maintained as a linked list where data in each node refers to a compartment.
